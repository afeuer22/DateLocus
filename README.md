The Main Code Branch is protected to ensure code is merged correctly and code is not lost by accident. Here are the correct steps to add or edit code:
To get the code:
1. Fetch the current git code from main
2. Pull the code from main
3. Checkout a new branch and name it
4. Push the code to the new branch
5. Make any code edits you want

When ready to push your code:

6. Add/commit with your commit message, and then push your code to your branch (not to main, which is not possible either way)
7. Create a pull request on the Github Website
8. Once your code is reviewed and approved, it will be merged to main
